Hi there! My name is Eric Larson and I am a data science student! After working at Epic for 5.5 years, travelling for a few months, and learning a bit of data science on my own, I'm part of the Metis Chicago/Online Spring 2020 cohort!

On this blog, I'll be documenting my experiences in Metis, including useful things I've learned, tip and tricks, project ideas, and hopefully, some completed projects.

If you want to get in touch with me, e-mail me at [elarson649@gmail.com](mailto:elarson649@gmail.com) or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-larson-26533687/).

Thanks for reading!
