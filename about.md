Hi there! My name is Eric Larson and I am a data scientist! After working at [Epic](https://www.epic.com/) for 5.5 years, travelling for a few months (see picture below), and learning a bit of data science on my own, I joined the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) Chicago/Online Spring 2020 cohort!

On this blog, I'll be documenting experience at Metis and my projects! If you want to get in touch with me, e-mail me at [elarson649@gmail.com](mailto:elarson649@gmail.com) or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elarson649/).

Thanks for reading!
